Things to do:

-- clean fmu templates:
         -- with events
         -- without events

    Must have ability to undo step, stubs for directional derivatives, data
    hiding (nothing in headers), minimal generic logging ability

-- timing infrastructure

-- hdf5 ability  

-- timing

-- test displacement/displacement and force/displacement couplings, wait
   for Edo to give input to do force/velocity

-- move this file to Jira

-- FMUs needed
   Stage 1: 
   a) mass + spring subject to force inputs, returns position + velocity
   b) mass + spring subject to a second coupling spring force depending on local x,v
   + x,v received from another FMU, and which returns the force of the
   coupling spring

   c) 2D rod to make chains

-- FMU cleanup:  revise examples from  QTronic

-- Future:  FMU cosim wrapper for FMU model exchange, including directional
            derivatives
