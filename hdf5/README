This contains a minimalistic C++ interface to HDF5.  The interface is meant
to be simple to use as shown in the example program ex1.cpp

The code is not documented yet but there are doxygen compatible comments
which should make that easy. 

There are issues with this because the HDF5 C++ API is NOT THREAD SAFE and
this is something that the HDF5 group is not addressing as of

Moving to the C library would not be too much work given how the interface
is built. This will be necessary however.
