Things to do:

-- Merge, rename to FMIGo, cleanup, code review (Tomas, Jonas, Claude)

-- FMU cosim wrapper for FMU model exchange, including directional
            derivatives (Jonas + Claude)

-- check performance on high performance switches, clusters, etc.
    Abisko for TCP/IP and MPI  (Tomas, when there's free time)

-- Servers for FMI/X
            -- support for directional derivatives and numerical Jacobians for Model Exchange support

-- Master stepper
         
          -- support for NEPCE from Benedikt 
          -- Support for TLM
          -- extrapolation + interpolation
          -- iterative methods
          -- event handling
          -- multirate
          -- model based extrapolation model reduction and identification (Benedikt) 
          inside FMU ModelExchange wrapper 
          -- Grand mix of model exchange and co-sim: master stepper
             takes change of several ME FMUs as well as cosim ones, and
             time-integrates the ME FMUs together with a sensible
             integrator.  (See Ziegler and Vangheluwe for theory)
